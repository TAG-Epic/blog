	<h1>Lets start with the backstory</h1>
	<p>
		Back a while ago someone posted <a href="https://discord.com/channels/710682414225162301/1289843326832349234">a suggestion about adding kamikaze drones to counter campers</a> which was not very well received
	</p>
	<img src={InitialThreadMessages} alt="the start of the 'can we have kamikaze drones' thread, with 48 downvotes and 0 upvotes with messages where 1 is threatening to quit VAIL, 2 is saying this would ruin the game and 1 is asking if they are making suggestions to make the game die" />
	<p>
		After that we entered into a 800+ message long thread about how something like this could be adapted into a mechanic that could work well in VAIL, being fun yet balanced for both new players and competitive players.
		However as the thread was going a new problem was encountered: new people are joining the conversation and is getting confused around the conversation.
		This makes a lot of sense as some of the messages has tons of messages between the message and the response to that message, and hell even multiple sub-conversations of the conversation trying to think of different ideas to see how they work, but ultimately ending up with them clearly not being viable. This makes for a discussion very hard to follow, and simply asking new people to the conversation to just "read up" is not ideal.
		<br/>
		The goal of this article will be to try and re-write the discussion from the conversation in a more structured and concise way, while still not sparing any of the details.

<h1>Universally hated ideas</h1>
<h2>The rainbow six seige drone</h2>

<p>
	This allows you to spawn a drone you control fully to spy on your enemy while you attack the defenders.
	The defenders can counter the drones with electrical utility or shooting the drones.

	This is a very cool concept for Rainbow Six Siege, but doesn't fit the pacing nor maps in VAIL.
