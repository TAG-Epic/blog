    <p>
        In the <a href="https://discord.gg/vailvr">VAIL VR discord</a> I often see people complain about network conditions and just blame it on ping to the point where people are blaming frame drops on ping.
        This annoys me <i>slightly</i> so I've decided to bite the bullet and write some frontend code to visualize what the different network conditions <i>actually</i> does to your gameplay.

        Right so as I will be sharing this in the <a href="https://discord.gg/vailvr">VAIL VR discord</a> whenever someone who don't know how games networking works complains about something and blames it on netcode or just tells the devs to "just magically fix netcode"<a href="#footnote-pls-fix-netcode">¹</a>,
        I need to consider that they probably aren't massive networking nerds. So lets go through some basic stuff:<br/>
        Your position isn't magically sent smooth to all the other players for performance reasons. It is instead sent as individual position ticks at a fixed tick rate<a href="#footnote-what-is-tickrate">²</a>

        This works fine, however the movement will be very choppy, which isn't ideal.

        <li id="footnote-what-is-tickrate">Tick rate is how many times a spesific action should be ran. Minecraft for example does all its game logic 20 times per second.</li>
