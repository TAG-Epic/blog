    <p>
        As you might know there was a exploit in vail for a *long* time that allowed you to freeze a hardpoint lobby forever. This exploit was abused by tons of people to grind stats.<br/>
        A while back I started tracking everyone's stats as I was receiving reports from friends catching GigaKnight abusing the hardpoint exploit to get to #1 on the kill leaderboards.<br/><br/>
        
        So back to present day, I have 67 million rows worth of stats and im tracking 77k vail users's stats constantly.
        Up to this day this data has mostly been used to create <a href="/public/assets/blogs/vail-cheaterboard/how-many-people-got-which-skin.png" target="blank">âœ¨ pretty graphs âœ¨</a> but today that is changing.
    </p>

    <h2>The Cheaterboard</h2>
    <Cheaterboard />
    <h2>Lets talk about the numbers</h2>
    <p>
    This data has been gathered by <a href="https://github.com/tag-epic/vail-api">my (unofficial) VAIL API</a> which is constantly watching the leaderboard for changes and then saving a snapshot of that user's stats in <a href="https://questdb.io">QuestDB</a> for timeseries purposes and also saved to our "hot" db using SQLite.<br/>
    Unfortunately I was a bit of a moron and accidentally wiped my database and misattributed stats to Maple ðŸ˜­, so this only counts data after 21 May 2024. <br/><br/>

    We detect exploited lobbies by checking for increases in <code>gamemode-hp-game-seconds</code> that are longer than hardpoints can possibly last while not increasing your <code>gamemode-hp-games-won</code>/<code>gamemode-hp-games-lost</code>/<code>gamemode-hp-games-drawn</code>. If any other wins/losses is registered, that snapshot is immediately discarded as I want to keep this as false positive free as possible.
    This works as stats are only submitted once a match is finished or you leave.
    The only false positive that can happen is that you join a hardpoint lobby -&gt; get kills -&gt; leave before it ends on repeat for the duration you are here on for. If you win/lose a single hardpoint game this won't count.
    False negatives has a decent chance of happening here, sadly not much I can do about it. This should catch most of the "major" exploiters anyway.

    <h2>Accidentally finding more cheaters</h2>
    <p>
    Before I knew that stats was misattributed to Maple for the first day the stat scraper was on, I ran the script with no cutoff and to my surprise Maple was #1 on the leaderboard with <code>1657</code> cheated kills.
    This was quite a surprise to me as Maple has been very against abusing the hardpoint exploit, so I DMed Maple.<br/>

    I may have then uh given maple a <i>mild heart attack</i> (oops, sorry!) after asking him. After which he did confess to using it, however we found out this was before I started tracking the stats so he is not on the cheaterboard.
